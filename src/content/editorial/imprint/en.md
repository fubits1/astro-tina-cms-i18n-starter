## Paragraph 3


The library was a quiet place, filled with the sound of pages turning. A young woman sat at a table in the corner, reading a book. She was so engrossed in her book that she didn't notice the old man who sat down across from her.


The old man looked at the young woman and smiled. He remembered a time when he was her age, and he used to spend hours in the library, reading everything he could get his hands on.


The old man cleared his throat. "Excuse me," he said. "I couldn't help but notice that you're reading a book by one of my favorite authors."


The young woman looked up from her book. "Oh, really?" she said. "Who's that?"


"His name is Gabriel García Márquez," the old man replied. "He's a Colombian writer, and he's considered to be one of the greatest writers of all time."


The young woman nodded. "Yes, I'm really enjoying his book so far."


The old man and the young woman continued to talk about books and authors for a while. The old man was happy to share his love of literature with someone who was so obviously passionate about it.


When it was time for the young woman to leave, she thanked the old man for the conversation.


"It was a pleasure," the old man replied. "I hope you enjoy the rest of the book."


The young woman smiled and waved goodbye. As she walked away, the old man watched her go. He felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that he had passed on his love of literature to a new generation.
