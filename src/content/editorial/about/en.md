## Paragraph 2


The spaceship landed in a clearing in the forest. The ramp extended, and a group of astronauts emerged. They were all dressed in white spacesuits, and their helmets were down.


The astronauts looked around the clearing, taking in the lush green trees and the sparkling blue stream that ran through it. They were on a new planet, a planet that had never been seen by human eyes before.


The astronauts had been traveling for months, and they were excited to finally be on their destination. They had come to this planet to explore it and to see if it was habitable.


The astronauts carefully made their way down the ramp and into the clearing. They took their first steps on this new world.
